    <h2>Why Mahavir Jayanti is celebrated </h2>
  <p>
    Mahavir Jayanti is an important religious festival celebrated by Jains worldwide. It marks the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, the 24th and last Tirthankara (enlightened being) of Jainism. Tirthankaras are spiritual leaders who have attained enlightenment and provide guidance to followers on the path of liberation.
    
    Mahavir Jayanti is observed on the 13th day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March or April) and is a day of great significance for Jains. The festival is marked by various rituals, prayers, processions, and charitable activities. Devotees visit Jain temples, perform puja (worship), and engage in meditation and spiritual discourses.
    
    On this day, Jains strive to follow the teachings of Lord Mahavir, which emphasize non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), non-stealing (asteya), chastity (brahmacharya), and non-possessiveness (aparigraha). These principles form the foundation of Jain philosophy and serve as a guide for leading a righteous and ethical life.
    
    Mahavir Jayanti is a time of reflection, introspection, and renewal of faith for Jains. It provides an opportunity to remember and honor Lord Mahavir's teachings and his contributions to the spiritual and ethical development of humanity. The festival promotes harmony, compassion, and respect for all living beings, aligning with Jainism's core principles of non-violence and peace.</p>
